# Final-Year-Project
This project focuses on the development of a Diabetic Retinopathy Management System, combining machine learning and real-time glucose monitoring to assist individuals in managing their eye and overall health.

The system leverages a machine learning model to analyze retinal images uploaded by the user, predicting the severity of diabetic retinopathy across its various stages. In addition, the project features integration with Dexcom’s Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system. This was achieved using Dexcom’s API to retrieve real-time glucose readings, which are displayed on the frontend interface, providing users with a visual representation of their blood glucose levels.

Purpose & Impact:
The integration of eye health analysis and glucose monitoring is driven by the well-established correlation between high blood glucose levels and diabetic retinopathy progression. This system aims to empower users to proactively monitor their condition from home, reducing their reliance on infrequent medical appointments and enabling more timely interventions.

This project was developed using:

Machine Learning (Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV) – Image processing & retinopathy detection.
Dexcom API Integration – Real-time glucose data retrieval.
React & JavaScript – Interactive frontend display.
Backend (Python/Flask) – API handling and data processing.

The goal is to support remote self-management for individuals with diabetes, promoting early detection and better long-term health outcomes.
